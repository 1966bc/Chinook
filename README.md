Chinook is a sample database available as an alternative to the Northwind database, being ideal for self education.

Chinook data model represents a digital media store.

I modified the tables, adopting a naming convention different from the original.

For example I put all the names of the fields in lowercase and added a status field on all the tables.

In this project you can see various object oriented programming techniques usefull when you use Tkinter Python3 and Sqlite3.

To run the project, execute chinook.py
