Chinook is a sample database available as an alternative to the Northwind database, being ideal for self education.

Chinook data model represents a digital media store.

I modified the tables, adopting a naming convention different from the original.

In this project you can see various programming techniques with Tkinter and Python.

To run the project, execute chinook.py
